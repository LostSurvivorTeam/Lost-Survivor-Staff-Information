The list below contains all rules and expectancies of all Lost Survivor Staff Team members.

--------------------------------------Rules------------------------------------------------

1. Treat all members of the staff and Discord with respect no matter their rank.

2. When banning someone make sure you gather evidence and present it to the Head Council
until then you may put the user into "time out" mode.

3. If you have been assigned work by someone of a higher rank than you don't push off the work, 
if you are unable to complete it at that time inform them so they can assign it to someone else.

4. Uphold all server rules and don't allow any violators to avoid punishment.

5. Any discovered Admin abuse will result in and immediate demotion and/or ban.

6. Stay calm with all members no matter their attitude, if a member refuses to cooporate you may
put them on a "timeout" for one day with explanation.

7. Use common sence, being a member of the Staff doesn't mean the normal rules don't apply to
you, they do.
